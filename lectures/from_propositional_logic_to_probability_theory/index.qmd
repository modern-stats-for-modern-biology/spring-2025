## Deductive and inductive reasoning

-   The goal of **deductive reasoning** is to determine whether an argument is valid, i.e., the **conclusion is guaranteed to be true**, assuming the premises are true

\begin{array}{ll}
1. & \text{All men are mortal} \\
2. & \text{Socrates is a man} \\
\hline
\therefore & \text{Socrates is mortal} \\
\end{array}
$$

## Scientific reasoning is inductive reasoning

> *All of the things we say in science, all of the conclusions, are uncertain.*
>
> *Scientific knowledge is a body of statements of varying degrees of certainty — some most unsure, some nearly sure, but none absolutely certain.*
>
> *And it is of paramount importance, in order to make progress, that we recognize this ignorance and this doubt.*
>
> *Because we have this doubt, we then propose looking in new directions for new ideas.*

## Scientific reasoning is inductive reasoning, but …

![](images/clipboard-3461289063.png)

This article discusses a study \[[Yao et al. (2023)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11192-023-04759-6)\] analyzing the frequency of hedging words, such as "might" and "probably", in scientific literature over the past two decades. The findings indicate that the use of such words has declined by approximately 40% during this period.

## What the &#%! is probability?

![](images/clipboard-452697347.png){height="200"}

## What the &#%! is probability?

-   **Ontological interpretations** (probability as an objective feature of reality)

    -   **Limiting relative frequency** (*frequentist*): The proportion of times an event occurs in an infinite sequence of trials (a.k.a. “long-run” relative frequency)

    -   **Physical chance/propensity**: The inherent tendency or disposition of a physical system to produce a particular outcome

-   **Epistemological interpretations** (probability as a subjective measure of uncertainty)

    -   **Rational degree of belief** in the truth of a proposition (*subjective Bayesian*): A personal but coherent assignment of probabilities to possible worlds, updated via Bayes' rule

    -   **Rational degree of evidential support**/the strength of an inductive argument (*objective Bayesian*): The proportion of possible worlds where both the hypothesis and the evidence are true, relative to the possible worlds where the evidence is true

::: notes
In this series of lectures, we focus on the **objective Bayesian** interpretation of probability, because it incorporates all the others–except when probability measures fundamental randomness (quantum mechanics)
:::

::: notes
Objective Bayesianism, in the absence of additional evidence, must agree with the classical interpretation. This is because objective Bayesians use principles like maximum entropy, which leads to the Principle of Indifference when no additional constraints are available.

Key Relationship Between Classical and Objective Bayesian Probability

-   Classical probability is a special case of objective Bayesianism when no extra evidence is available

-   Objective Bayesianism extends classical probability by allowing non-uniform priors when justified by additional evidence or logical constraints

## Artificial intelligence

::: nonincremental
-   Our goal in this series of lectures is to program an **artificial intelligence (AI)**: A computer algorithm that is capable of logical reasoning (deductive and inductive)

-   To achieve this, we need a way to translate a logical argument from English to a language that the computer understands
:::

-   Specifically, we will use:

    -   **Propositional logic** (mathematical language) to formalize **deductive reasoning**

    -   **Probability theory** (mathematical language) to formalize **inductive reasoning**

    -   **R** (programming language) to translate a deductive or inductive argument written in the language of propositional logic or probability theory into a computer algorithm

## From propositional logic to probability theory

-   **Propositional logic** is a mathematical language that we use to:

    -   **represent knowledge** with propositions (logical variables), and
    -   **reason** about the **truth** of propositions, given a knowledge base

-   **Probability theory** extends propositional logic to **reason** about the **plausibility** of propositions, given a knowledge base

## Sample space and outcomes

-   The universe/**sample space** ($\Omega$) is the set of all possible worlds/**outcomes** ($\omega$), i.e., the set of all possible combinations of truth-value assignments for a given set of atomic variables

-   The sample space for a set of $n$ atomic variables consists of $2^n$ possible outcomes

::: fragment
$$\Omega = \{ \omega_1, \omega_2, \ldots, \omega_{2^n} \}$$
:::

-   For example, given a set of two atomic variables $A$ and $B$, the sample space consists of four possible outcomes

::: fragment
|  $\Omega$  |      $A$       |      $B$       |
|:----------:|:--------------:|:--------------:|
| $\omega_1$ | [TRUE]{.green} | [TRUE]{.green} |
| $\omega_2$ | [TRUE]{.green} | [FALSE]{.red}  |
| $\omega_3$ | [FALSE]{.red}  | [TRUE]{.green} |
| $\omega_4$ | [FALSE]{.red}  | [FALSE]{.red}  |
:::

## Sample space and outcomes

```{r}
#| include: false
vars <- c("A", "B")

ss <-
  expand_grid(!!!set_names(map(vars, ~ c(TRUE, FALSE)), vars)) %>%
  mutate(Ω = paste0("⍵", 1:n())) %>%
  select(Ω, everything())

ss
```

```{r}

    A = c(TRUE, FALSE),
    B = c(TRUE, FALSE)) %>%
  mutate(Ω = paste0("⍵", 1:n())) %>%
  select(Ω, everything())

ss
```

## Propositions and events

-   An **event** is a subset of the sample space, including the empty set ($\emptyset$) and the sample space itself ($\Omega$)

-   Event $X$: the subset of the sample space where proposition $X$ is true

-   The terms **proposition** and **event** are often used interchangeably

-   Probability applies to propositions/events

    -   $P(X)$ = probability that proposition $X$ is true

    -   $P(X)$ = probability that event $X$ occurs

-   A **tautology** is a proposition which is true in every possible world (certainly true)

-   A **contradiction** is a proposition which is false in every possible world (certainly false)

-   A **contingent proposition** is one that is true in some possible worlds and false in others

## Artificial intelligence for inductive reasoning

-   We will implement this $P$ function in R to build an AI for deductive reasoning

    -   **Input**: A deductive argument with one or more premises (`P1`, `P2`, …) and a conclusion (`H`)

    -   **Output**: A `Numeric` value, measuring the inductive strength of the argument

-   First, we will program this computer algorithm step-by-step

-   Then, we will wrap it up into a reusable function called `P`

-   We will use the *proportional syllogism* (a classical argument that is foundational to statistical inference) as an example

## Proportional syllogism

The proportional syllogism is a logical argument that draws a conclusion based on a proportion

::::: columns
::: {.column .fragment .nonincremental}
**Premises**

-   A bag contains two blue balls and one white ball

-   One ball is drawn from the bag

**Conclusion**

-   A blue ball is drawn from the bag
:::

::: {.column .fragment .nonincremental}
$$
\begin{array}{ll}
1. & B1 \lor B2 \lor W1 \\
2. & \neg((B1 \land B2) \lor (B1 \land W1) \lor (B2 \land W1)) \\
\hline
\therefore & B1 \lor B2
\end{array}
$$

## Proportional syllogism

The proportional syllogism is a logical argument that draws a conclusion based on a proportion

$$
\begin{array}{ll}
1. & B1 \lor B2 \lor W1 \\
2. & \neg((B1 \land B2) \lor (B1 \land W1) \lor (B2 \land W1)) \\
\hline
\therefore & B1 \lor B2
\end{array}
$$

-   The goal is to assess the **inductive strength** of this argument, i.e., to measure how likely the conclusion is to be true given that the premises are true

-   We will assess the inductive strength of this argument following these steps:

    -   Build the truth table of this argument
        -   First, create a data frame with all possible combinations of atomic variables
        -   Second, add columns for premises ($E = P1, P2$) and conclusion ($H$)
    -   Calculate the proportion of rows where $E$ is true, in which $H$ is also true (probability)

## Proportional syllogism

Artificial intelligence for inductive reasoning implemented in a single line of R code! 🤯

```

-   In this example with **two (2) blue balls** and **one (1) white ball**:

::: fragment
$$P(H \mid E) = 0.6667 = \frac{2}{2 + 1}$$
:::

-   In general, for any number of blue balls ($b$) and white balls ($w$):

::: fragment
$$P(H \mid E) = \frac{b}{b + w}$$
:::

-   This mathematical formula captures the logic of the proportional syllogism, which also gives the probability of success in a [Bernoulli trial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernoulli_trial)

-   This logic is fundamental to probability theory and inductive reasoning

## From propositional logic to probability theory

-   Desiderata of probability theory ([Cox's theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cox%27s_theorem))

    -   Probability theory must be consistent with propositional logic

    -   Probability theory must respect common-sense directional rules

    -   Probability theory must provide a quantitative measure of inductive strength

::: notes
-   Probability theory must generalize propositional logic to handle degrees of plausibility
-   Probability theory must preserve qualitative consistency (e.g., stronger evidence should not decrease probability)
-   Probability theory must assign numerical values to plausibility, enabling quantitative inductive reasoning
:::

-   Axioms of probability theory

    -   Inductive strength is a real number: $\: P(H \mid E) \in \mathbb{R}$

    -   All available background information must be considered

    -   Laplace's [principle of indifference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_indifference): Equal ignorance implies equal probability

::: notes
A longer definition of the principle of indifference (also called the principle of insufficient reason):

“When there is no available evidence or rational basis to favor one possibility over another, all possibilities should be assigned equal probability. That is, if a set of disjoint and exhaustive outcomes are indistinguishable given the known information, they must be treated as equally probable.”

-   [One probability to rule them all?](https://youtu.be/HCG57e7Ogv8?si=2PY1EBoPfjLdS6yd)

## From propositional logic to probability theory

-   Probability measures:

    -   how strongly the premises entail the conclusion

    -   the inductive strength of an argument

    -   the degree of entailment of an argument

    -   the plausibility of the conclusion, given the premises

    -   how likely the conclusion is to be true, assuming the premises are true

-   **All probability is conditional!** There is no such thing as $P(H)$, only $P(H \mid E)$

-   Once the premises and the conclusion are subjectively chosen, the resulting **probability is entirely objective**: [Probability theory is just counting!](https://youtu.be/_NEMHM1wDfI)

## Probability theory: Fundamental theorems

From the axioms of probability theory, it can be mathematically proven that:

-   $P(A \mid C) = 1$ iff $A$ is certainly true ($\top$), given $C$

-   $P(A \mid C) = 0$ iff $A$ is certainly false ($\bot$), given $C$

-   $0 \le P(A \mid C) \le 1$

-   $P(A \land B \mid C) = P(A \mid C) \cdot P(B \mid A \land C)$

## Probability theory: Bayes' rule

$$P(B \mid A) = \frac{P(B) \cdot P(A \mid B)}{P(A)}$$

-   This theorem is the single most fundamental equation in probability theory and inductive reasoning, including statistical inference and scientific reasoning

-   Bayes’ theorem is more than just a formula: It captures the *mathematical shape* of uncertainty, or more precisely, the *dynamics* of how uncertainty updates in response to new information

-   For example, in cognitive neuroscience and AI, it provides a foundation for modeling and understanding how the brain works

-   Bayes’ theorem is undoubtedly one of the most revolutionary ideas in human history!

## Association does not imply causation

::: fragment
"Correlation is not causation" - correlation is just a special case of statistical association
:::

::: fragment
Two propositions/events $A$ and $B$ are associated iff they are NOT independent
:::

-   $P(A \mid B) \ne P(A)$

::: fragment
or, equivalently
:::

-   $P(B \mid A) \ne P(B)$

::: fragment
For example,
:::

-   $P(\text{heart attack} \mid \text{high cholesterol levels}) > P(\text{heart attack})$

-   $P(\text{shark attack} \mid \text{high ice cream sales}) > P(\text{shark attack})$

::: fragment
We bring causation to probability; we do not get causation from probability!
:::

## Association does not imply causation

A statistical association is a logical relationship between two propositions/events and does not imply a causal relationship between them

::: fragment
For example,
:::

-   reducing cholesterol levels lowers the risk of a heart attack (causal relationship), however

-   reducing ice cream sales does not lower the risk of a shark attack, even though there is a statistical association between high ice cream sales and shark attacks

## Probability calculation

::: fragment
The probability of proposition/event $X$ is calculated as
:::

::: fragment
$$P(X) = \sum_{\omega \in X} p(\omega)$$
:::

::: fragment
For example, if proposition $X$ is $A \lor B$, then $P(X)$ is
:::

::: fragment
```{r}
ss %>%
  mutate(p = 1 / n()) %>%
  mutate(X = A | B) %>%
  filter(X) %>% 
  summarize(`P(X)` = sum(p))
```
:::

::: fragment
or more succinctly

::: fragment
```{r}
ss %>%
  mutate(p = 1 / n()) %>%
  mutate(X = A | B) %>%
  summarize(`P(X)` = sum(p[X]))

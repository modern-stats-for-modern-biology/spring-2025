::: notes
In the typical introductory statistics course, students are introduced to a great number of concepts: variance, z-score, normal distribution, p-values, ANOVA, t-test, and many others. At the end of the course, however, many students have difficulty appropriately transferring what they have learned to new situations.

Students and researchers alike end up practicing statistics as a set of rituals, a series of actions repeatedly performed in a prescribed order without judgment. Triggered by a certain set of conditions, our students happily “run the analyses” and report the results, all without a deep understanding of why they did what they did, or what the results mean.

Modern statistics has moved beyond the assumptions and mathematical approximations of the last century; it has become a computational science, gradually replacing tools such as the normal distribution with techniques such as simulation, randomization, and resampling. We also have seen a shift from an emphasis on Null Hypothesis Significance Testing (NHST) to the construction and evaluation of statistical models.

::: notes
Many statisticians argue that we should stop teaching NHST and/or mathematical approximations altogether (https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2515245918771329)

The critique is not just leveled at the teaching of statistics, but also to statistics as practiced by researchers. Nature published a comment with 800 signatories calling for an end to these statistical practices by scientists (https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-00857-9)

P-values have taken quite a beating lately.

Moving beyond dichotomous decision making to estimation with uncertainty

Moving beyond estimation \[of a population parameter\] with uncertainty to predictive inference and scientific reproducibility

Observables are fundamental, the goal of statistical modeling should be to predict future observations, given the current data and other relevant information

Take-home message:

**Avoid the use and be wary of "dichotomous/bright-line thinking", embrace uncertainty and be thoughtful, open, and modest!**
:::

## Focus on understanding and transfer

::: fragment
In a traditional course, students master bits of knowledge (e.g., t-test, chi-square, ANOVA, regression, and so on) but often fail to develop a coherent understanding of how the bits are connected together. This results in fragmented knowledge that doesn't transfer.

:::

::: notes
Coherent and interconnected knowledge that can be transferred to new contexts.

Students must practice making connections between core concepts, representations, and the world (i.e., contexts and practices involved in applying those concepts).

## Focus on statistical modeling

The course is organized around the concept of statistical modeling and the practice of data analysis: exploring variation, modeling variation, and evaluating models.

## Focus on computational approach

-   Modern statistics has moved beyond the rigid assumptions and mathematical approximations that were necessary for performing data analysis without a computer

-   It has become a computational science, replacing tools such as the CLT and statistical tables with techniques such as simulation, shuffling, and resampling

## Getting your technology ready

In order to use the online book from [CourseKata](https://coursekata.org/), three things are critical:

1.  You must use a computer or tablet

2.  You should use Chrome as your browser

3.  You must allow third-party cookies

## Getting support

CourseKata support is accessed by clicking on the blue icon with a “CK” that appears on the bottom right corner of each page (see picture).

![](https://i.postimg.cc/k7yHkQts/CKHelp.png){alt="Image of CourseKata Support button" width="1280"}

Click on the CK icon to browse or search the knowledge base: find descriptions of R functions used in the book, explore a glossary of statistical terms, or read articles on how to solve common technical issues.

If you need technical support you can submit a ticket to CourseKata support.

## R sandbox and cheatsheet

-   The **R sandbox** is a place where you can practice writing R code and seeing the results

-   The **R cheatsheet** contains the R functions used in the course

-   You can find the R sandbox and cheatsheet links in the **Resources** folder of the **CourseKata** section of the course on [Blackboard](https://learn.mssm.edu/)

## Tracking your progress

When you’ve completed all exercises on a page, a **Completed** badge appears at the top of the page (see picture).

![](https://i.postimg.cc/qqs1yZ8b/uwRfLtB.png){alt="Image of Complete badge at the top of the page"}

For a more comprehensive view of your progress through the book, go to the **My Progress + Jupyter** page, the first link in the **CourseKata** section of the course on [Blackboard](https://learn.mssm.edu/). This page will show you which pages you have completed, and which ones you still need to work on. **You can follow the same link to get to your Jupyter notebooks**.

## Tips for learning more

The text and exercises in this online book are designed to help you **think deeply** about the concepts introduced. We’ve found that the most successful students are those who **read the book slowly and carefully**, complete all exercises, and answer all practice and review questions to the best of their ability.

Because the book is designed to be read slowly, try not to put off your reading assignment until the last minute. If you wait until it’s too late, you won’t have time to go through the pages carefully. You will end up skimming, and if you skim, you won’t learn nearly as much.

## Try again...

Don’t just work through the pages once. If you really want to learn, go through them again, especially if you find the material difficult to understand.

When you work through a page again, don’t just look through your previously scored responses. Clear them out, and generate the answers again. Lots of research shows that you will learn more by **answering again** — much more!

## ...and again

Your initial responses to the embedded assessment questions reappear if you leave a page and return to it later. For this reason, pages you have completed that include such questions will have a \<Try Again\> button at the top (see picture).

![](https://i.postimg.cc/L4LCchrt/kaUkiV3.png){alt="Image of RConsole explaining Script.R and RConsole windows"}

The best way to review a page is to click the \<Try Again\> button. You can do this as many times as you wish. You might find this particularly helpful on the review questions at the end of each chapter.

NOTE: **Only your initial answers are saved. Using the \<Try Again\> button won’t change the answers your instructor will see from you**.

## Group project and presentation

-   You will work in groups of \~3 (randomly selected within the class).

-   The group is encouraged to use data from their own research work or publicly available from published biomedical studies.

-   Your job as a group will be to plan and carry out an analysis of the data based on a specified research question(s) and then describe your analytical process including descriptive and inferential statistics as well as appropriate visualizations.

-   You will present your analysis to the class as well as produce a Jupyter notebook consisting of a description of the data, research question, analytical approach, findings and conclusions, in the same format as the Jupyter notebooks you worked on throughout the class.

-   You should work with other students in your group in preparing and presenting the project and the Jupyter notebook should indicate the role each person played in the project.
